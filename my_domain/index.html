        Hey there! You found my domain.<br>
        Thanks for finding my little corner of the internet. 
        My site isn't exactly buzzing with traffic or ranking high on SEO, so if you're here, 
        it's safe to say you've got a genuine interest in little ol' me. And hey, I appreciate that!.<br>

        I'm Victor, but you can call me the one and only AI_Optimizer! Okay, okay, no one actually calls me that yet, 
        but I'm working on it.&#128524;<br><br>
        For the last 365+ days, I've been hitting the grindstone, practicing and training to 
        become a full-stack software engineer. And let me tell you, my coding skills are so hot, 
        they could power a spaceship to Mars! Well, maybe not, but I'm ready to tackle some real-world problems.<br><br>

        Before I discovered my love for coding, I spent over 10 years as an aircraft maintenance engineer. Yeah, 
        you heard me right, I was fixing and maintaining all kinds of crazy machinery, and now I'm ready to apply 
        that same technical know-how to coding.<br><br>

        In the hopes of being the actual AI_Optimizer, I am studying applied artificial
        intelligence in my limited free time. My goal? To maximize the efficiency of every posssible 
        system using AI.<br><br>
        
        So, if you're looking for an eager intern who's ready to tackle any challenge, hit me up! I'm all about 
        the hard stuff and learning something new every day.<br><br>
        -Victor
