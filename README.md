# The Difference :
### HTML: :wrench: :hammer:
In simpler terms, think of HTML as the building blocks of a webpage. It's like a set of instructions that tells web browsers how to display different elements,
such as text, paragraphs, heading, images, and videos, on a page. 
### CSS: :rainbow:
In simpler terms, think of CSS as the "stylist" for your webpage. It's what makes your webpage look visually appealing and well-designed.
CSS works by specifying rules for how different HTML elements should be displayedâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.

## HTML pointers :
* [RESSET](./resset.css) : Every web browser has its own default styles for different elements. How `Google Chrome` renders headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth may be different from how `Internet Explorer` does. To ensure cross-browser `compatibility`, it is a good practice to implement a `resset` of all parts and elements of your html to a `uniform` basic raw form , before implementing your actuall `css` styling. 
This file contains the popular `Eric Meyer's` css resset code, which would be linked in the `head` element of the basic HTML code, to resset every other values of each element to a uniform font,colour,size etc. Subsequently, the content of the file will be copied into the begining of our other csss files.

* SEMANTIC_CODE : Dessist from styling, colouring or adding fonts to your page using HTML, that is the job of `css` in a seperate file. HTML should be the carrier of the page content structured properly with the proper elements and tools. This gives an ideal interpretation of the content , meaning and usage of the page to both the computer and human users. Including `css` sstyling codes in your `HTML` code file is bad practice:x:
Also use semantic tags to accurately describe their purpose and describe the type of their element content. Semantics tags clearly describe the purpose of a code,
makes the code easier to read , makes the site more accessible , leads to better SEO. Some semantic tags
    - `<p>`	defines a paragraph of a document
    - `<header>`	defines the header of a document or section of a document.
    - `<footer>`	defines the footer of a document or section of a document.
    - `<nav>`	define a section of the page that contains navigation links.
    - `<article>`	used to specify independent, self-contained content. Also represents a self-contained piece of content that can be reused.
    - `<aside>`	defines some content aside from the content it is placed in. It is more like a sidebar.
    - `<main>`	specifies the main content of a document.
    - `<section>`	defines the the stanalone section of a document.
    - `<details>`	defines additional details that the user can view or hide
    - `<summary>`	defines the visible heading for the `<details>` element.

* [SPECIAL_CHARACTER](./special_char_link.txt) : Special characters include various punctuation marks, accented letters, and symbols. When typed directly into HTML, they can be misunderstood or mistaken for the wrong character by either the computer or human; thus they need to be encoded. In this file is a link with a long list of characters and their direct codes.

* HIEARACHY and INDENTATION : HTML elements are hierarchical, which means that they can be nested inside each other to create a tree-like structure of the content on the web page. Code should be well-formed and properly indented, with each element on its own line and each level of hierarchy indented by one level. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and can help to avoid errors. 

* HTML Accessibility : This is a good as Semantic coding getss. The website should be easily accessible to the disabled who would rely on the computer to break down the contents of the website. This is only easily efficient if the HTML content is semantically written and the page contents properly outlined. This includes :
    - Proper use of Headings - `h1`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>`
    - HTML lang attribute
    - Descriptive link text
    - Use of button tag
    - Good Alternative Texts for images = `alt`
    - ETC


* [BASIC_HTML](./basic.html) : This file contains a basic html file structure with some description comments.
    - Avoid long lines of codes. If long text should be in one line on web page, break them into multiple lines in the HTML code
    - Use proper indentations, white spaces and blank lines , for readability.
    - Never skip the `<title>` element in your HTML document
    - Never skip the `<html>` , `<body>` , and `<head>` tags. This is the first step to semantic codes
    - The lang attribute is vital to include within an `<html>` element. Its primary goal is to define the natural language of the content. 
    Browsers and search engines use this information for a more accurate page ranking in search results. If there's a piece of text in a different language, 
    you can specify the language with the lang attribute for the element that surrounds the content.
    - Give everything the appropriate hierarchy.
    - Titles should not be longer than 50 characters as search engines ignore text after 50 characters and generally, most screens cannot display titles longer than 50 characters.
    - Try to be as unique as possible, duplicate titles don't do well in SEO rankings and may cause confusion for users.
    - Some elements are self closing eg. `<br> <embed> <hr> <img> <input> <link> <meta> <param> <source> <wbr>`
    - Observe and use `block` and `in-line` elements properly
        * Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. 
        Block-level elements may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements eg- `<header> , <p>` , etc
        * Inline-level elements must not begin on a new line. They fall into the normal flow of a document, 
        lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content. Inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; 
        however, they cannot wrap block-level elements. eg, `<span> <a> <pre>` etc
    - always set the height or width of images. Otherwise when the image loads, the content on the webpage will be shifted.
    - `<strong>` and `<em>` are semantic tagss used to put emphasis, even though they both bold and italics the texts withing them respectively.
    `<b>` and `<i>` can be used respectively in place of them.
    - some text formating tags 
        * `<b>` tag - Bold Text
        * `<i>` tag - Italic Text
        * `<u>` tag - Underlined Text
        * `<strong>` tag - Strong Text
        * `<em>` tag - Emphasized Text
        * `<mark>` tag - Highlighted Text
        * `<sup>` tag - Superscript Text
        * `<sub>` tag - Subscript Text
        * `<del>` tag - Deleted Text
        * `<ins>` tag - Inserted Text
        * `<big>` tag - Big Text
        * `<small>` tag - Small Text

## CSS pointers:
* SYLING IN HTML : with a `<style>` tag and element in your HTML code, you can specify some of the design presentation of your HTML document. This is generally
not advisable as this limits the semantics of your HTML documents. Although in some cases, adding some type of styling in the HTML document is unavoidable, it
is good practice to always make your styling in a different CSS code file, and link them in your HTML file.

* SELECTORS : Selectors are used to indicate which HTML element to style. This would range from specifying an entire type of element (Type selectors), to
identifying a particular element with a tag, and using the tag(Class, Id) to select the elements.

    - Type Selector - selects all elements of a specific type, for example, p will select all p elements
    - Class Selector - selects all elements with a specific class name, for example, .myclass will select all elements with class="myclass".
    Elements within HTML can have more than one class attribute value so long as each value is space separated. 
    With that, we can place certain styles on all elements of one sort while placing other styles only on specific elements of that sort.
    - ID Selector - selects a unique element with a specific ID, for example, #myid will select the element with id="myid".
    - Universal Selector - selects all elements on the page, for example, * will select all elements.
    - Attribute Selector - selects elements with a specific attribute, for example, [type="text"] will select all elements with type="text".

* PROPERTIES AND VALUES : These are used to set and define the preference, appearance and characteristics of the different property values of the selected elements.

    - Color - sets the color of the text, for example, color: red;.
    - Background-color - sets the background color of an element, for example, background-color: #fff;.
    - Font-size - sets the font size of the text, for example, font-size: 16px;.
    - Font-family - sets the font family of the text, for example, font-family: Arial, sans-serif;.
    - Line Height - the distance between two lines of text (often referred to as leading) is declared using the line-height property.Line height may also be used to vertically center a single line of text within an element. Using the same property value for the line-height and height properties will vertically center the text:
    ```
    .btn {
        height: 22px;
        line-height: 22px;
    }
    ```
    - BOX MODEL: every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have width, height, padding, borders, and margins.
        * ![My Image](assets/box-model.PNG)
        * Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. For example, margin: 10px;
        * Border - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line, for example.Borders can have different appearances.
        The most common style values are solid, double, dashed, dotted, and none,  border: 1px solid black;
        * Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your box., for example, padding: 10px;.
        * Width - sets the width of an element content, for example, width: 100px;.
        * Height - sets the height of an element content, for example, height: 100px;.
        * Box-sizing - property used to change exactly how the box model works and how an elementâ€™s size is calculated.
        eg. box-sizing: border-box;
            -   the border-box value alters the box model so that any border or padding property values are included within the width and height of an element. When using the border-box value, if an element has a width of 400 pixels, a padding of 20 pixels around every side, and a border of 10 pixels around every side, the actual width will remain 400 pixels.If we add a margin, those values will need to be added to calculate the full box size. No matter which box-sizing property value is used, any margin values will need to be added to calculate the full size of the element. The margin and padding properties are completely transparent and do not accept any color values. Being transparent, though, they show the background colors of relative elements. For margins, we see the background color of the parent element, and for padding, we see the background color of the element the padding is applied to.
    - Display - sets how an element should be displayed, for example, display: `inline-block`. Block-level elements occupy any available width, regardless of their content, and begin on a new line. `Inline-level` elements occupy only the width their content requires(cant have their box model properties changed) and line up on the same line, one after the other. `Inline-block` element value will allow an element to behave as a block-level element, accepting all box model properties (EG WIDTH, PADDING ETC). However, the element will be displayed in line with other elements, and it will not begin on a new line by default.
    - Float - Essentially, the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page, and position it to the left or right of its parent element. An element with a display value of inline, such as the <span> inline-level element, ignores any height or width property values. However, should that inline-level element be floated, its display value will be changed to block, and it may then accept height or width property values. Eg - section {float: left;}
    To prevent content from wrapping around floated elements, we need to clear, or contain, those floats and return the page to its normal flow. Eg footer {clear: both;} :
    to clear from both left and right floats.

    When building a website, it is always best to write modular styles that may be reused elsewhere, and reusable layouts are high on the list of reusable code. Layouts can be created using either floats or inline-block elements.





* RULES : 
    - CASCADE: Within CSS, all styles cascade from the top of a style sheet to the bottom, allowing different styles to be added or overwritten as the style sheet progresses.

    - SPECIFITY: Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. A selectorâ€™s specificity weight, along with its placement in the cascade, identifies how its styles will be rendered. Specifity weight is from lowest to highest TYPE -> CLASS -> ID. For example, if a paragraph element is selected using a type selector in one place and an ID selector in another, the ID selector will take precedence over the type selector regardless of where the ID selector appears in the cascade.

    - COMBINNING SELECTORS: Selectors can be combined with a space between them to target different elements with same group of properties and values at the same time.

    - VENDOR PREFIX: CSS Vendor prefixes (or browser prefixes) are a way for browsers to give access to new CSS features(properties) not yet considered stable. By using prefixes, we can use these newer CSS features with the browsers that support them â€” instead of waiting for all browsers to catch up.
    Common vendor prefixes: Mozilla Firefox: `-moz-` , Microsoft Internet Explorer: `-ms-` , Opera: `-o-`, Webkit (Google Chrome,Apple Safari,Andriod,IOS): `-webkit-`
    In most cases, to use a brand new CSS style property, you take the standard CSS property and add the prefix for each browser.The prefixed versions would always come first (in any order you prefer) while the normal CSS property will come last. When a property or value needs a vendor prefix, the prefix will only be used in the introduction of that property or value (in the interest of keeping our code digestible and concise). eg
    ```
    div {
    -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
          box-sizing: content-box;
    }
    ```
