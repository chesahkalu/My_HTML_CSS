        >Created with love and fueled by the joy of
        parenthood, our Baby Milestone Tracking App is the
        brainchild of a couple on their journey through a
        software engineering program. While navigating the
        delightful challenges of raising their two-year-old
        son, they found themselves deeply engrossed in his
        growth and development. As they explored various tools
        and apps to track his milestones, an idea was sparked:
        why not utilize their newly acquired coding skills to
        build a tool tailored to their needs?<br />
        <br />
        This inspiration led to the birth of our Baby
        Milestone Tracking App – a tool meticulously designed
        to celebrate and support the monumental journey of a
        child&#039;s growth. Merging the realms of parenthood
        and software engineering, they&#039;ve created an
        application that not only simplifies tracking your
        child&#039;s development but makes it an enjoyable
        experience.<br />
        <br />
        From our family to yours, we share this tool with the
        hope that it helps illuminate the path of your
        child&#039;s development and milestones as it did
        ours.<strong
